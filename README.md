# React Query Playground with JSONPlaceholder API

#### Overview

This repository serves as a **working example of React Query** fetching data from the **Fake REST API** ([JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)). The purpose of this project is to provide a **base setup for experimenting with React Query**, including options for caching, stale time, and query invalidation.

It is designed for **personal reference and for anyone looking to quickly set up a React Query playground**.

---

## Features

- Fetches a list of posts from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) using React Query, demonstrating efficient data fetching and caching.
- Adds a new post via the API’s `POST` method. Since the API does not persist new posts, the newly created post is temporarily appended to the list for demonstration purposes.
  - Showcases how React Query automatically re-fetches data when invalidating the correct `queryKey`, ensuring the latest data is retrieved from the API.
- Implements **React Query** with various options (caching, refetching, stale time).
- Uses **React 19** and **Vite**
- Modular and reusable query setup for easy experimentation.
